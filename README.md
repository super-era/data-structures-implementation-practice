# data-structures-implementation-practice

Here, I practice implementing a range of data structures in Java.

## Implementations so far

- Linked list - from-scratch implementation of a linked list containing nodes with integer data
(The bidirectional version is on branch LL_bi, whereas branch 'main' contains the unidirectional version.)
- Heap - min and max, using an integer array to hold and identify the heap's contents
- Queue - from-scratch implementation with integer data
- Stack - from-scratch implementation with integer data
- Graph with adjacency list - contains method to add adjacency matrix to adjacency list attribute in the class
