# linked-list
(branch LL_bi)

This project is an implementation of an integer-data bidirectional linked-list data structure.
For the unidirectional implementation, look at the main branch.

Methods include:
- adding nodes
- removing last node
- removing first node
- removing nodes based on the data attribute they contain
- sorting a linked list in ascending/descending order
- printing node and list contents 

# Ideas for future implementation

- use binary search in removeNodeByData()
- develop a graphical representation of linked-list operations with javax.swing
